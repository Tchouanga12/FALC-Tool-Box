# FALC Tool Box

The **FALC Tool Box** is a translation toolkit specifically designed to convert French text into **FALC (Facile à Lire et à Comprendre)**, or "Easy to Read and Understand" French. FALC simplifies complex information, making it more accessible to everyone, including people with cognitive disabilities, dyslexia, the elderly, or individuals with limited proficiency in French. The tool is developed to promote inclusivity by enabling clear, concise, and easily understandable communication.

By breaking down linguistic barriers, the FALC Tool Box empowers individuals to better engage with written content, ensuring equitable access to information for all.
