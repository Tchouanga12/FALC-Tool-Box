# FALC-Tool-Box
In this work, we create a tool box to translate from French to FALC (Facile A Lire et Comprendre) i.e. easy to read and understand. FALC makes information simpler and clearer and is therefore useful to everyone, including people with disabilities, dyslexia, the elderly, and people with poor knowledge of the French language.
